## Functional Javascript

Javascript has long been a misunderstood programming language. Its roots
come from Self and Scheme, a prototypical and a functional programming
language respectively. Not very mainstream! Yet, Javascript has evolved
into one of the most widespread programming languages in the world! In
this presentation you will learn what it means for a language to have
first class functions and you will learn functional programming with
higher order functions. I will show how to use functional programming
techniques in Javascript and how these techniques can help you organize
your code.
