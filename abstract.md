## Functional Javascript

Javascript has long been a misunderstood programming language. Its roots
come from Self and Scheme, a prototypical and a functional programming
language respectively. This is hardly what we have been taught in
school. In this presentation you will learn what it means for a language to have 
first class functions and you will learn functional programming with
higher order functions. I will show how to use functional programming
techniques in Javascript and how these techniques can help you organize
your code.
